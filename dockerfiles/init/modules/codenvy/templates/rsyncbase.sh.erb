# Key for SSH connection to sync files
SSH_KEY=/opt/codenvy-data/conf/ssh/key.pem
# When Codenvy runs on windows we have issue since key doesn't have permissions 0600.
# With another permissions on key SSH doesn't work.
# So we copy key into another place that should be inside of container - so it is Linux and permissions are supported.
# And apply needed permission to copied file. Copying is performed lazily, so it is skipped when it was done previously.
# ensure ssh key has correct permissions
